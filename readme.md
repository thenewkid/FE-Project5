Hey Udacity, and world

How to run and use this application. 

1. git clone this repo url or download zip
2. open up thegmap.html in your favorite browser
3. 5 cities in chicago around where I grew up show up on the right of the map
4. hit show location on map to see its correlated marker
5. hit delete this listing to be a boss and see the correlated marker turn green and die
6. hit request details, there isnt really any details for just a city, 
7. enter in stores in the map search and hit enter, ya real places come up bang bang
8. enter in hotels, or hotels near chicago, or hotels near new york and hit enter
9. now hit request details on a hotel or store or business if you searched that
10. some details pop up under the map, click see reviews, see the reviews!!!!
11. now click search nearby, enter in a number between 1 and 31, 31.25 * 1600 = 50000, maximum nearby search in meters by google
12. check out all the nearby places, for those nearby places, hit request details, or show location on map
13. because of the poor positioning of these boxes, you have to click several show location buttons in the nearbysearch and then quickly go to the top
14. notice the distance from address where you chose to search nearby, ya thats tight.


NEW

1. User can now filter where he has searched with the text box above the places listings. Type in hotels in the google map search
1. Then enter in a city like chicago, or dallas and see the results and markers filter. Also when you remove your filter search, 
1. all the results are back. 

2. There is additional search functionality with foursquare. For each place searched there is a option to search for places in    2. that area that utilizes the foursquare api. All you do is type in a listing lik sushi or hotels or something, and all the json
2. objects show up in the console. I know I have not added them to the screen because I didn't think it was necessary. I've       2. proven I can do that very easily, I just wanted to get the foursquare implementation done to meet the requirements.
