Hey Udacity, and world

How to run and use this application. 

1. git clone this repo url or download zip
2. open up thegmap.html in your favorite browser
3. 5 cities in chicago around where I grew up show up on the right of the map
4. hit show location on map to see its correlated marker
5. hit delete this listing to be a boss and see the correlated marker turn green and die
6. hit request details, there isnt really any details for just a city, 
7. enter in stores in the map search and hit enter, ya real places come up bang bang
8. enter in hotels, or hotels near chicago, or hotels near new york and hit enter
9. now hit request details on a hotel or store or business if you searched that
10. some details pop up under the map, click see reviews, see the reviews!!!!
11. now click search nearby, enter in a number between 1 and 31, 31.25 * 1600 = 50000, maximum nearby search in meters by google
12. check out all the nearby places, for those nearby places, hit request details, or show location on map
13. because of the poor positioning of these boxes, you have to click several show location buttons in the nearbysearch and then quickly go to the top
14. notice the distance from address where you chose to search nearby, ya thats tight.
